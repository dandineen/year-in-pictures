Only one of us persevered... the other one watched Netflix!"

We'd gone for a New Year's walk, a lovely crisp sunny day in the depths of Northumberland, followed by lunch in a converted railway carriage standing in defunct Bellingham Station (now a Tourist Information Centre). Good company, good walk, good food - what better way to start 2020!"

What this photo doesn't show is 4 young bull calves hidden the other side of the hedge preparing to chase us down this very path. Nothing like a little bovine rage to make you pick up the pace."

Instead, here is a picture of gnome sitting in a bowl. He was judging me as I ordered a pizza (required because of the aforementioned broken fridge) and I've enjoyed this picture every time I've come across it.<br ><br >Here's hoping 2020 picks up!<br ><br >From <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/tomnatt/49465762527/\">Flickr</a>."
