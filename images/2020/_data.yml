Every year we visit a wonderful nature reserve near Naples, Florida called Corkscrew Sanctuary.  Sometimes you see lots of birds and sometimes you don't.  This year Richard managed to photograph both a male (multi coloured) and a female (green) Painted Bunting.  It makes us smile just thinking about it.  We were lucky.  Take care and stay healthy."

    description: "There's either lots or nothing to talk about this month so I chose to highlight something funny. Early in May my Google Fit came up with a random number for my remaining move minutes. Initially the number reminded me  of some kind of spooky film where some kind of technology may show you a countdown until your death. Some quick calculations later it works out as just under 620 years so if it is a death clock, it's predicting my being turned into a vampire..."

    description: "June has proven to be rather a “drag” for us overall. Yes, a few more openings and restrictions lifted. We had friends over for drinks one hot afternoon and our son just spent a week with us working from Richard’s office. We had a walk with Tom’s parents to Coopers Hill (cheese rolling hill) and we were advised that our holiday to Lundy Island is still happening. So you would think, in retrospect, we should be smiling!  However, we along with many others we have spoken to lately,  have been feeling rather blue and weary and fed up.  Life has become monotonous and this feeling of constraint is wearing very thin. So, in short, not a joyful time in the Green household presently and a good laugh was needed. We found this card unexpectedly in the card box and it made us laugh right out loud so took a photo and emailed to everyone we know!  We hope it makes you smile at the very least.\r\n PS. It’s an Anniversary Card just in case you didn’t know..."
