You can sit on it, and some people tried to pose for photos while doing so, but they never look as good as when it's empty."

After a very scrappy first half Bath fought back valiantly and it was a cracking game. At this point it could have gone either way, and this kick was critical to the result. He missed.

There are now some 250 cultivars, the collection having been started by Henry John Elwes (1846-1922). The present day Sir Henry wanders the grounds during February weekends chatting to the visitors, including the day we were there in torrential rain.

    description: It is possible to sleep surrounded by walls of snow and ice 200km north of the Arctic circle but I'm not sure I'd call it a hotel. It's more like the tombs of the Pharaohs carved out of ice instead of sand but I can see why they might not have decided to market it that way. The building is entirely constructed of frozen water which melts away each summer. It still has fire extinguishers in every corridor though.
