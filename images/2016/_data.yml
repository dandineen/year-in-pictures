    description: One of several signs outside a pub (Golden Pheasant in Burford) which caught my eye. A landlord who is working hard to attract customers with an unusual (if not scientifically correct) sales pitch.

    caption: Lightbench
    description: "Lumiere London was a free \"light festival\" in which works of art that look good in the dark were left all over London. This one was called Lightbench and was by Bernd Spiecker. You can sit on it, and some people tried to pose for photos while doing so, but they never look as good as when it's empty."

    description: "After a week of rain there was finally a good winter day, sunny and cold. People made the most of it. They didn't seem to mind the height, or that I stood taking photos. They probably wouldn't have cared if I tried to point out it wasn't exactly a safe or sensible thing to do - at least that's what I told myself."

    caption: Rugby at the Rec
    description: "I have lived in Bath for nearly 15 years and this is the first game I've seen at the Rec. The atmosphere was fantastic and the Bath skyline made for a beautiful backdrop. After a very scrappy first half Bath fought back valiantly and it was a cracking game. At this point it could have gone either way, and this kick was critical to the result. He missed.
