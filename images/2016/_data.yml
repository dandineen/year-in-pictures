    caption: Lightbench
    description: "Lumiere London was a free \"light festival\" in which works of art that look good in the dark were left all over London. This one was called Lightbench and was by Bernd Spiecker. You can sit on it, and some people tried to pose for photos while doing so, but they never look as good as when it's empty."

    description: "After a week of rain there was finally a good winter day, sunny and cold. People made the most of it. They didn't seem to mind the height, or that I stood taking photos. They probably wouldn't have cared if I tried to point out it wasn't exactly a safe or sensible thing to do - at least that's what I told myself."

    caption: Rugby at the Rec
    description: "I have lived in Bath for nearly 15 years and this is the first game I've seen at the Rec. The atmosphere was fantastic and the Bath skyline made for a beautiful backdrop. After a very scrappy first half Bath fought back valiantly and it was a cracking game. At this point it could have gone either way, and this kick was critical to the result. He missed.

    description: ...plenty of Snowdrops at Colesbourne Park in the Cotswolds. It is renowned as one of the best places to see large groups of choice snowdrops and is known as 'England's greatest snowdrop garden.' There are now some 250 cultivars, the collection having been started by Henry John Elwes (1846-1922). The present day Sir Henry wanders the grounds during February weekends chatting to the visitors, including the day we were there in torrential rain.

    caption: Ice Palace
    description: It is possible to sleep surrounded by walls of snow and ice 200km north of the Arctic circle but I'm not sure I'd call it a hotel. It's more like the tombs of the Pharaohs carved out of ice instead of sand but I can see why they might not have decided to market it that way. The building is entirely constructed of frozen water which melts away each summer. It still has fire extinguishers in every corridor though.

It could have been hotter when it hit the table, but otherwise a successful venture...

    description: Poignant display showing some of the tokens and medals mothers left with their children when handing them over to the Foundling Hospital (the UK's first children's charity, founded in 1739). Parents were asked to leave something unusual, in the remote chance of a later reunion, many left patches of clothing. It's a small museum, but worth a look.
