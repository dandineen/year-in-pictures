    caption: "Woofy"
    description: "An incredible experience walking with a pack of three Arctic Wolves at the UK Wolf Conservation Trust in Beenham, courtesy of Ed and Shelley. They kept us under close control as we went around a field and it was very easy to forget they weren't dogs until they stood next to a person and we saw how big they are. A wolf has the IQ of a five year old human and the ability to learn via observation. They keep trying to work out how to escape from their enclosures although it seems to be more because they can than because they want to.<br ><br >Only disappointment of the day lay in my photography equipment. I felt the limitations of my phone camera for the first time when looking back at <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/tomnatt/sets/72157679727701615\">my photographs</a>. This is one of the better pictures, although it was taken at the enclosure rather than on the walk, hence the annoying fencing.
