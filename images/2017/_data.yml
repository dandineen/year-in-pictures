    description: "Terry Pratchett wrote about the tendency of humanity to 'pin down' parts of the world with big, beautiful and permanent buildings. When the sun hit York Minster for probably the first time in 2017, you could imagine the thousands of Januarys it has witnessed, and the comforting sense that this too shall pass, be it winter, marginal referendums or bewigged lunatics with nuclear weapons. Happy New Year!"

    caption: "Woofy"
    description: "An incredible experience walking with a pack of three Arctic Wolves at the UK Wolf Conservation Trust in Beenham, courtesy of Ed and Shelley. They kept us under close control as we went around a field and it was very easy to forget they weren't dogs until they stood next to a person and we saw how big they are. A wolf has the IQ of a five year old human and the ability to learn via observation. They keep trying to work out how to escape from their enclosures although it seems to be more because they can than because they want to.<br ><br >Only disappointment of the day lay in my photography equipment. I felt the limitations of my phone camera for the first time when looking back at <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/tomnatt/sets/72157679727701615\">my photographs</a>. This is one of the better pictures, although it was taken at the enclosure rather than on the walk, hence the annoying fencing.
