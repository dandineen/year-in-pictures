    description: "An incredible experience walking with a pack of three Arctic Wolves at the UK Wolf Conservation Trust in Beenham, courtesy of Ed and Shelley. They kept us under close control as we went around a field and it was very easy to forget they weren't dogs until they stood next to a person and we saw how big they are. A wolf has the IQ of a five year old human and the ability to learn via observation. They keep trying to work out how to escape from their enclosures although it seems to be more because they can than because they want to.<br ><br >Only disappointment of the day lay in my photography equipment. I felt the limitations of my phone camera for the first time when looking back at <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/tomnatt/sets/72157679727701615\">my photographs</a>. This is one of the better pictures, although it was taken at the enclosure rather than on the walk, hence the annoying fencing.

The original idea was that they would be mass-produced and used as chalets or holiday homes - however the rise in the cost of oil (and therefore plastic) in the 1970s meant that fewer than 100 were ever made. There are thought to be 60 still in existence, one of which is currently sitting on the roof of Central Saint Martins in King's Cross. It was rescued and restored by the artist Craig Barnes and once a month he opens it up, lets people inside and talks them through the lengths he went to to save the house. There's more information, with photos of the building in various stages of dilapidation and renovation, on <a href=\"http://www.futurohouse.co.uk/\">the house website</a>."

    description: "We're part of a community led acquisition of the village shop which, from May, is run on a voluntary basis 7 days a week. The village pub was purchased on a similar basis 4 year's ago. The retiring shop owners had 3 days off in 47 years! One to collect an OBE for services to the village, 1 when a relative died, and the other when they were just too ill to serve! Tesco is quaking in its boots at the competition we're now threatening!"

    description: "A neighbour's cat climbed about 30ft up one of our pine trees to escape this fox, who is learning to hunt. After two days of unsuccessful coaxing and 'pulley bucket/carrier systems' I had to call out our tree surgeon. He was not impressed especially after being urinated upon and badly scratched (by the cat) for his trouble."

    description: "Out hiking around Gatcombe Park we encountered this lovely dry stone wall, sadly collapsed leaving just the capping in place. Obviously, as an amateur dry stone waller myself this poignant scene made me cry inside but I couldn't pass up the opportunity to play with some of the features of my new camera/phone so here we have a wide aperture shot, giving the blurring in the background.<br><br>From <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/tomnatt/34577088222/\">Flickr</a>."
