    image_title: A Record Shop In Valletta, Malta
    caption: My Heritage (x2)
    description: "While on holiday in Malta I visited this record shop which had a lengthy Guardian article printed-out and stuck in the window. The headline read \"The World's Oldest Record Shop: on the vinyl frontier since 1894\" - and celebrated the history Spillers Records in Cardiff. As a product of both Wales and Malta, I spent ages trying to work out why a shop in Valletta would be so interested in the history of a store in Cardiff... Until I spotted the date above their own door."
