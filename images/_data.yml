    description: "While on holiday in Malta I visited this record shop which had a lengthy Guardian article printed-out and stuck in the window.

As a product of both Wales and Malta, I spent ages trying to work out why a shop in Valletta would be so interested in the history of a store in Cardiff... Until I spotted the date above their own door."
