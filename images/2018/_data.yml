    description: "First signs of new growth in the garden always makes me want Spring to hurry up and arrive. The Snowdrops are here, but also Daffodil bulbs are sprouting forth, with some hints from the Tulips just poking through the soil, and here and there some germinated seeds of various coloured Poppies are giving promise of a colourful ride through to summer. But the leftovers of winter are still evident elsewhere in the garden, with lots of branches broken by the weight of snow now waiting to be cut back and cleared away to the refuse tip. A garden never sleeps..."

    description: "New Year's Day has to include a walk, so we did a couple of bridges in downtown Portland, Oregon, namely Steel Bridge and Burnside Bridge (there are 12 in total across the Willamette River). The one behind the motley crew is imaginatively called Steel Bridge because .... well you can probably work out why! Built in 1905 it carries local trams, trains, vehicles and pedestrians. The middle section rises between the towers to allow shipping to pass through. Overall, it's quite a bit of Meccano."

    description: "The second of Jan to be precise.  It was sunny and mild.  From where I stood you could see Athens stretch out in every direction; all the way to the sea (not in the picture); all the way to mount \"Aigaleo\" (in the picture); all the way to mount \"Parnitha\" (not in the picture); all the way to mount \"Pendeli\" and all the way to mount \"Ymmitos\" (also not in the picture.  Athens is pretty much surrounded by mountains!).  It really gives you a feel for the huge size of the capital, although admittedly only a fraction of the size of London (just for perspective).  Anyways, I love a good vantage point, especially if it involves a mountain.  Extra bonus if there are more than one!  :D"

I think they are cormorants, mentioned in Swallows and Amazons as coming all the way from China and in Monty Python being rubbed with linseed oil. There was only one for many years but now more have arrived. I once saw him wrestle an eel which wrapped itself around his neck as he tried to swallow it. The cormorant won. They can stay under water for so long you assume they've surfaced elsewhere and stop looking, then it pops up right next to you with a fish in it's beak."

Thanks to Lyns for arranging everything. We learned a lot - most importantly that the bad guys get all the best music. Highly recommended if you've got the patience to wait for a showing, and sit through around 5 hours of play. <br ><br >From <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/tomnatt/40292210182/\">Flickr</a>."
