The Snowdrops are here, but also Daffodil bulbs are sprouting forth, with some hints from the Tulips just poking through the soil, and here and there some germinated seeds of various coloured Poppies are giving promise of a colourful ride through to summer. But the leftovers of winter are still evident elsewhere in the garden, with lots of branches broken by the weight of snow now waiting to be cut back and cleared away to the refuse tip. A garden never sleeps..."

The one behind the motley crew is imaginatively called Steel Bridge because .... well you can probably work out why! Built in 1905 it carries local trams, trains, vehicles and pedestrians. The middle section rises between the towers to allow shipping to pass through. Overall, it's quite a bit of Meccano."

Athens is pretty much surrounded by mountains!).  It really gives you a feel for the huge size of the capital, although admittedly only a fraction of the size of London (just for perspective).  Anyways, I love a good vantage point, especially if it involves a mountain.  Extra bonus if there are more than one!  :D"

They can stay under water for so long you assume they've surfaced elsewhere and stop looking, then it pops up right next to you with a fish in it's beak."
