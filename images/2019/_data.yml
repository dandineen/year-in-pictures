    caption: "The Tenor Bell"
    description: "Recently I was asked to talk to the local Mothers Union about bell-ringing and took some photos inside the belfry at Minchinhampton church for the presentation. This photo is of the tenor bell which was cast in 1825 and is the heaviest bell there at approx 600kg. Notice the large wheel with the bell-rope attached; this allows the bell to be swung through 360 degrees and controlled in timing to within 0.05 seconds, despite its weight and turning momentum. This is unique to English-style bellringing, prevalent mainly in the UK plus a few towers in Australia, New Zealand, the US, Canada and South Africa."

    description: "I spent January working on a special edition of the BBC One Wales comedy show <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bmfpy5\">Tourist Trap</a> - which will be broadcast during the Six Nations Championship. Excitingly, we were given permission to film inside the Principality Stadium itself which, when there isn't a game on, is an enormous, baffling maze of identical looking corridors and rooms.<br ><br >I'm not really allowed to share photos of the show before broadcast. This was taken with my back to the cast-and-crew, and pointing out towards the pitch itself - clearly being prepared for when the championship starts in February."

Sometime in the 1800’s Thomas Clerkson (an Abolitionist) stayed there whilst carrying out his research on Bristol’s slave trade for the anti-slavery campaign. There is also a plaque on the wall about him."

We hunted it down because it's one of the hidden points of photographic interest in London.<br ><br >The tiny spec at the end is a person vanishing around the corner. I didn't wait another second for them to go because to my right, out of shot, is another person striding forth to get into shot.
